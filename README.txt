 -- Practice automation testing with Rest Assured --
*** Introduction ***: 
  This is my practice exercise in automation testing with Rest Assured. In this exercise, I have completed the following tasks:
  1 - Created Maven project and Installed TestNG
  2 - Add libraries to pom.xml file
  3 - Created two folders:
      
      BTMau: Contains test cases with the POST method.
      ThucHanh: Contains test cases with the GET method.

  4 - Using RestAssured to compare the expected result with the actual result after sending an API request.
  5 - In the "ThucHanh" folder, create a file named "testng.xml" to execute all test cases within this folder
